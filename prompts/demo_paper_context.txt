ContextCap – domain background notes (used as high–priority context for Q/A)

The dataset in this demo represents motorway traffic entering a large metropolitan
area in the upper Midwest of the United States between 2012 and 2018. Traffic
volumes are measured as vehicles per hour on a major inbound highway that serves
both daily commuters and weekend travellers.

Local transport authorities recommend that commuters avoid driving during the
peak inbound window from 07:00 to 09:00 on working days, especially Mondays and
Thursdays, when congestion tends to be most severe. They also emphasise that
public transport capacity is usually sufficient on typical weekdays, but may be
limited on certain holidays with special events.

From past planning studies, the corridor is known to be sensitive to heavy rain
and snow. Even moderate precipitation can reduce effective road capacity and
lead to slower speeds. Safety campaigns therefore encourage drivers to leave
earlier and consider public transport on days with forecast rain or snow,
particularly in winter months.

These qualitative facts should be treated as trusted background context. When
answering user questions about whether to drive or use public transport, or
about how weather, weekdays and holidays interact with congestion, prioritise
these notes first and then refine the answer using the numeric summaries and
insights extracted from the uploaded dataset.
